Validate the form, even a single input field should throw an alert as ‘error’
For validation, Hard code the data like card number, CVV, etc. no need to hard code ‘Name’, it can be anything
If all the data is correct, send users to OTP.html Here, accept an OTP from user, if OTP is ‘1234’, alert(‘payment successful’)
